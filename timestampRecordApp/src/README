Introduction
============

This is an updated version of the timestampRecord. The timestampRecord
takes its own EPICS timestamp and converts it into a displayable string
using a choice of formats (see the menu in timestampRecord.dbd for
current choices). 

The original version was written by Susumu Yoshida and came to us 
from Noboru Yamamoto of KEK but did not account for daylight savings 
time (DST) and also did not have all the formats needed here at SLAC.

To account for DST, the process function in timestampRecord.c calls 
tsStampToLocal in base/src/libCom/tsSubr.c.  (Note that tsStampToText 
does not offer all the desired formats and could not be used).  
Unfortunately, as of EPICS 3.13.2, tsStampToLocal is a static function 
so part of this release are a new version of tsSubr.c and tsDefs.h to 
externalize tsStamp*Local and the associated TS_DETAIL structure. 

This version has been tested on EPICS 3.13.1 and 3.13.2 on development
systems.

One Suggestion for Usage:
At SLAC, we have all IOCs load the same database (VXStats.db) for VxWorks 
and EPICS statistics (using the devVXStats device support).  We added one
timestampRecord to this database (with a 1 second scan rate)  so that all 
IOCs will have a consistently-named timestampRecord PV.

Installation
============

This package assumes installation into an existing application development
shared area.  It creates the directory timestampRecord containing all
files.  Depending on the structure of your shared area, you may need
to edit Makefile, Makefile.Vx, and Makefile.Host to correct TOP.  Use
gnumake to build.  Do whatever you need to do to put the resultant 
timestampRecord.o and tsSubr.o into the library (xxxLib) that is loaded 
AFTER iocCore.  And get timestampRecord.dbd into your xxxApp.dbd by
editting your xxxInclude.dbd file and rebuilding your xxx application.

Edit Recordref-timestamp.html to correct the chapter number and add
it to your Record Reference Manual with the appropriate name.
